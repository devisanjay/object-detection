# object-detection
🧠 Project Title: Object Detection [Classification + Localization]
📌 Objective
The goal of this notebook is to perform object detection, which involves both:

Classification: Identifying what object is present in the image.

Localization: Drawing bounding boxes around the identified object.

🗃️ Contents Overview
✅ 1. Library Imports
The notebook uses:

TensorFlow, Keras, and tensorflow_datasets for deep learning and data handling.

PIL.Image and matplotlib.pyplot for image processing and visualization.

numpy and os for numerical operations and file handling.

📏 2. Image Configuration
Sets image dimensions and specifies that bounding box coordinates are normalized (i.e., values between 0 and 1).

🖼️ 3. Visualization Functions
Defines custom utility functions to:

Convert image arrays to PIL format.

Draw bounding boxes on images using the provided coordinates.

Overlay labels or detection confidence strings (optional).

Functions include:

draw_bounding_boxes_on_image_array(...)

draw_bounding_boxes_on_image(...)

draw_bounding_box_on_image(...)

These functions are designed to support visualization of predicted bounding boxes during object detection tasks.

🧪 Next Steps Likely Include:
Loading a dataset (e.g., from tensorflow_datasets)

Preprocessing images and annotations

Building or loading a model (possibly CNN-based)

Training or evaluating the model

Using the visualization functions to draw predicted boxes
